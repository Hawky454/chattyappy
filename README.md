# ChattyAppy




 * My intent is to make a simple chat room app using React JS.  The purpose is to have a nice little interactive chat room while I hone my skills in React.

 * I will be utilizing the Chatkit API

 * User should be able to create a new chatroom
 * User should be able to delete an existing chatroom
 * User should be able to interact live with with other users in the same chatroom
 * Users should be able to communicate via video in the chatroom

 * I'm using React JS for my front end framework and I'm employing CSS Grid and CSS Variables so I consciously decided not to use a CSS framework for this project. I chose these three technologies because I really want improve my skills with them.
