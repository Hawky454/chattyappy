#...This readme is still under construction

# My intent is to make a simple chat room app using React JS.  The purpose is to have a nice little interactive chat room while I hone my skills in React.

# I will be utilizing the Chatkit API

# User should be able to create a new chatroom
# User should be able to delete an existing chatroom
# User should be able to interact live with with other users in the same chatroom
# Users should be able to communicate via video in the chatroom
